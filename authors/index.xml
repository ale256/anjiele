      <description>&lt;p&gt;Former CTO of Philips Healthcare, founder of Supersonic, Sonosite and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was honoured to directly report to Acad Jacques Souquet during my time at &lt;a href=&#34;http://esonicimage.com/en/&#34;&gt;E-Sonic Imaging&lt;/a&gt;, where he is the Chairman and co-founder. During that time, he shared a lot with me about his vision for the future of medical imaging and population health. He is an important mentor of mine, and has definitely shaped my career goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We co-wrote the patent &amp;lsquo;Artificial Intelligence Integrated Diagnostic Platform Device in Ultrasound Modality&amp;rsquo;, together with a colleague of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He kindly wrote a letter of recommendation for me and authorized its unrestricted use.&lt;/p&gt;
